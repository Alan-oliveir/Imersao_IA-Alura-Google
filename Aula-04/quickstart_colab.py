This tutorial shows you how to get started with the Gemini API using the Python SDK.

## Prerequisites

You can run this tutorial in Google Colab, which doesn't require additional environment configuration.

Alternatively, to complete this quickstart locally, see the Python guidance in [Get started with the Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/quickstart).

## Install the SDK

The Python SDK for the Gemini API is contained in the [`google-generativeai`](https://pypi.org/project/google-generativeai/) package. Install the dependency using pip:
"""

!pip install -q -U google-generativeai

"""## Set up your API key

To use the Gemini API, you'll need an API key. If you don't already have one, create a key in Google AI Studio.

<a class="button" href="https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get an API key</a>

In Colab, add the key to the secrets manager under the "ðŸ”‘" in the left panel. Give it the name `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. Then pass the key to the SDK:
"""

# Import the Python SDK
import google.generativeai as genai

GOOGLE_API_KEY='GOOGLE_API_KEY'
genai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)

"""## Initialize the Generative Model

Before you can make any API calls, you need to initialize the Generative Model.
"""

model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro')

"""## Generate text

This tutorial was modified for learning in 'Imersao IA'.
"""

response = model.generate_content("Vamos aprender conteÃºdo sobre IA. Me dÃª sugestÃµes.")
print(response.text)

"""## What's next

To learn more about working with the Gemini API, see the [Python tutorial](https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/python_quickstart).

If you're new to generative AI models, you might want to look at the
[concepts guide](https://ai.google.dev/docs/concepts) and the
[Gemini API overview](https://ai.google.dev/docs/gemini_api_overview).
